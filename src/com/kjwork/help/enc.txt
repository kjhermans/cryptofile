How to encrypt files for people you know
----

1. General principle of assymetric encryption.

This program is based on assymetric encryption. That is a form of encryption
where you use two different keys: one key to encrypt something, and another
to decrypt it. These keys are different in that the key with which you encrypt
something, the so-called 'public key', has less information in it, than the key
that is used to decrypt a message - the so called 'private key'.

What follows is that you can give the public key to someone you know (they
may have it), and let them use it to encrypt a message for you. When you've
received this message, you can decrypt it with the private key (which you
should absolutely keep for yourself). An analogy would be of a very special,
but empty, envelope that only you can open: you can send it to friends,
they put a letter in it and seal it. Then they send the envelope back to you
and - since only you can open it - you can read it.

Bear in mind that even the friend cannot read the message back. In the
physical world, where every copy of information may be unique, this would
perhaps not be a smart thing to do. But this is the digital world, and copies
of information are potentially endless: so the envelope can be used again and
again, and you don't even have to make a new special envelope for another
friend: you can produce just one public key and give a copy of it to each
friend who wants to send you information, and they can each use this public
key again and again.

2. How encryption is used in this program.

So you need a private key (to keep for yourself, to decrypt messages), and
a public key (which is a derivate of the private key, which you can give to
friends, and which is used to encrypt messages). And likewise, your friend
needs a private and a public key. In order to encrypt files for people you
know, you need to know their public key.

In this program, you have a list of public keys from people you know.
